Deep Learning Programming Test I
================================

In this test we are looking for you to train a neural network to take two
square images and output the angle by which the first image has been rotated to
produce the second. All pairs of input images are to be of the same
scale, with rotation carried out about the centre of the image.

You are expected to form your own dataset for training and testing of this task
from public datasets/images/videos.

Your model will also be tested on an undisclosed private dataset.

Please send us all training code, and an inference program for testing (this
program should take two JPEG or PNG images as commandline arguments and output
a single floating point angle.

All code is expected to be in Python or C++ and run on Linux.

You will be asked about your training methodology and network design in your
interview as well as how you might improve your network/model.
